## Next Steps Based on MVP Plan

### Week 1 (Current Priority)
1. **Complete Admin Dashboard**: Develop a functional admin dashboard interface.
2. **Complete Volunteer Dashboard**: Develop a functional volunteer dashboard interface.
3. **Add Personal Schedule View**: Implement a view for volunteers to see their scheduled shifts.
4. **Enhance Volunteer-Admin Messaging**: Complete the messaging system for communication.

### Week 2
1. **Complete Shift Management**: Add functionality for editing and deleting shifts.
2. **Enhance Inventory Management**: Add functionality for deleting inventory items.
3. **Improve Frontend for Shifts**: Create a user-friendly interface for volunteers to view and manage shifts.

### Week 3
1. **Implement Automated Reminders**: Create a scheduled task to send reminders for upcoming shifts.
2. **Create Feedback Form**: Add a feedback submission system for volunteers.
3. **Implement Expiration Alerts**: Create a system to generate alerts for items nearing expiration.
4. **Develop Barcode Scanning**: Add functionality to scan barcodes for inventory updates.

### Week 4
1. **Implement Hours Tracking**: Create a system to track and report volunteer hours.
2. **Enhance Reporting**: Develop comprehensive inventory and donation reports.
3. **Create Donor Systems**: Implement donor preference lists and impact reports.

## Conclusion
The project has a solid foundation with core authentication, database models, and basic API endpoints implemented. However, significant work is needed to complete the user interfaces, especially the admin and volunteer dashboards. The current implementation focuses primarily on backend functionality, while the frontend components are minimal.

According to the revised MVP plan, the focus should be on completing the Week 1 features first, especially the dashboards and personal schedule view, before moving on to the more advanced features in the later weeks.
